As "clean" energy grows its share of society's energy mix, it is becoming more important to
consider the up- and downstream implications of these newer systems. A common claim is that,
while generating fewer carbon emissions directly, clean energy is still quite materially intensive,
both in terms of upstream extraction and downstream disposal. This claim is not easily
quantified, given the distributed nature of cleantech supply chains. However, multi-regional,
environmentally extended input-output analyses offer a meaningful way to wrap our arms
around this material intensity. The motivation of this study is to execute a simple, first attempt at
input-output analysis and generate some basic metrics around the material intensity of a given
clean energy source.

For this project, I focus on nuclear energy in France. I chose this because the
"cleanness" and "greenness" of nuclear power are especially contested and because the
broader EU has been forced to consider the (other) nuclear option in response to the disruption
of Russian gas supplies to the bloc, using increased nuclear energy to replace gas and coal in
electricity production. This case is quite relevant to the current conversations happening around
energy in Europe. For the sake of comparison, I also analyzed Poland's coal-powered
electricity sector.
